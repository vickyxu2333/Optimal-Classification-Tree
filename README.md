# Optimal-Classification-Tree
Compared to tree algorithms like CRAT, ID3, C4.5 recursively partitioning in a greedy fashion, the OCT(Optimal Classification Tree) proposed by Bertsimas and Dunn attempts to find the global optima by solving a MIP problem. We shall comprehensively benchmark OCT against CART on the 5 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository

The first dataset: Credit approval prediction

The second dataset: Liver disease detection

The third dataset: Climate model crash identification

The fourth dataset: Compound classification

The fifth dataset: Vehicle recognition
