# Optimal-Classification-Tree
Compared to tree algorithms like CRAT, ID3, C4.5 recursively partitioning in a greedy fashion, the OCT
(Optimal Classification Tree) proposed by Bertsimas and Dunn attempts to find the global optima by solving
a MIP problem. We shall comprehensively benchmark OCT against CART on the 5 datasets from the
UCI machine learning repository.
